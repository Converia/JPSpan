provides tools to "hook up" PHP and Javascript, for the purpose of fetching data from PHP into a web page which has already loaded, without reloading the entire page.

The objective is to make connecting a Javascript client with a PHP server as painless and error-free as possible. To this end [[start|JPSpan]] allows you to define a class in PHP and call it's methods directly (and remotely) from Javascript. That means if you have a PHP class like;

```
<?php
//...

class Math
{
    function multiply( $x, $y )
    {
        return $x * $y;
    }
}

//...
?>
```

You can use this class "natively" from JavaScript on the //client-side//, calling it like this:

```
var m = new math();
alert( m.multiply(2,2) );
```

The intent is to make building "sticky" DHTML or web-based [[http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xul/|XUL]]  applications, where the user interface remains static (not reloaded) in the users web browser, while data can be fetched dynamically from a remote web server, in response to user events.
